#🫀 MedInsight AI – AI-Powered Personal Heart Health Insight Tool 

 

#📌 Project Overview 

MedInsight AI is an AI-powered, educational health analytics application that helps users understand their heart-related health metrics by comparing them against age-based recommended clinical ranges and generating plain-English insights. 

This project demonstrates how a Data Analyst can combine domain knowledge, analytics, visualization, and AI to convert raw health numbers into interpretable, user-friendly insights — without performing diagnosis or prediction. 

⚠️ Disclaimer: 
This application provides educational insights only and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.

#🎯 Problem Statement 

Many individuals have access to health measurements such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate, but lack context to understand: 

Are these values normal for my age? 

Which numbers should I pay attention to? 

When should I consider consulting a healthcare professional? 

At the same time, healthcare data is often presented in technical formats that are difficult for non-medical users to interpret. 

This project addresses that gap by building an AI-powered analytics tool that transforms structured health inputs into age-aware, interpretable insights suitable for everyday users and non-technical stakeholders. 

 

#🧠 What This Project Does (Analytics-First) 

This project is not focused on diagnosis or disease prediction. 

Instead, it focuses on: 

Contextual interpretation of health metrics 

Age-based comparison against recommended clinical ranges 

Clear communication of potential risk signals 

Responsible AI usage for explanation and summarization

#🧠 How AI Is Used (Responsible & Ethical) 

AI is used only for interpretation and explanation, not prediction. 

The AI model: 

Receives summarized user health data 

Explains which values are within or outside recommended ranges 

Generates educational insights 

Provides a non-diagnostic recommendation on whether consulting a doctor may be advisable 




#📌 The AI is explicitly instructed to: 

Avoid medical diagnosis 

Avoid treatment advice 

Use simple, non-technical language 

 

#🛠️ Tech Stack 

Python 

Streamlit – Web application framework 

OpenAI API – Insight generation 

Pandas – Data handling 

Altair – Interactive visualizations
